## To Do Applicaton
A functional, simple react app. This project served as a great exercise in understanding React concepts such as props, components, state changes and handling form submissions. I had a lot of fun creating this small project, eventually, it became complicated with all the code but managed to make something out of it through online resources and changed the colours to my liking.
